This is my data analysis project of Covid19 dataset, which shows the global number of infected cases, deaths, and vaccinations related to Covid-19. 

The granularity level of the dataset is per continent per country, within the time period of 2020 January to 2021 April. 

This project consists of 2 main parts: the first part is exploring and understanding the Covid19 data via SQL (in the environment of Google BigQuery), and the second part is creating dashboard and visualizations in Tableau.
